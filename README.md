## How to use this repository?

There are two main parts:
- The rapid prototyping jupyter notebook that contains the bleeding edge features hidden in smelly code
- The partly tested application code in the `application.py` file, which can be used to run the application via it's main function

The rest of this readme is a task for my future me ;)
